## üìñ Project Overview
The system was developed as part of a CEN466 course project.  
It demonstrates how **FPGA-based systems** can provide precise, efficient, and scalable digital timekeeping compared to traditional microcontroller solutions:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

- **Digital Clock**: Displays hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- **Stopwatch**: Independent counters for seconds and hundredths of seconds.  
- **User Interaction**: Pushbuttons and switches to control start, stop, reset, and display mode.  
- **Display**: Four multiplexed 7-segment displays with Binary-to-BCD conversion.  
- **FPGA Advantage**: Real-time, parallel processing with reliable timing and scalability:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Details
### Key Components
1. **Counters (accu.vhd)** ‚Äì Track seconds, minutes, hours, and stopwatch values.  
2. **Comparators (comparator.vhd)** ‚Äì Detect counter limits and handle cascading increments.  
3. **Debouncer (debouncer.vhd)** ‚Äì Ensures reliable push button interaction:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
4. **Converters** ‚Äì Binary-to-BCD and BCD-to-Seven-Segment for display logic.  
5. **Mode Control** ‚Äì Multiplexing logic allows selecting between:
   - Seconds/Minutes  
   - Minutes/Hours  
   - Stopwatch  

### FPGA Board
- **Cyclone V (5CGXFC5C6F27C7N)**  
- Push buttons for increment/reset/start/stop  
- Switches for mode selection  
- 7-Segment display output:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## üî¨ Testing and Results
- **Digital Clock**: Verified against a real clock for accuracy.  
- **Stopwatch**: Start, pause, resume, and reset functions worked reliably without interfering with the clock:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
- **Manual Increment**: Extra feature to set hours and minutes manually.  
- **Result**: Real-time performance, stable user inputs, and accurate display updates.
